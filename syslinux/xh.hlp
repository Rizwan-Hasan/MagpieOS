Buyela mainUncedo Lomlayishi Womiselo Lwenkqubo.optIzikhethwa Zomiselo LwenkquboThere are two types of boot options available. First, there are options that affect the installer. Second, there are kernel options. Some of the more common options are:
a) installer options 
  • o_installhlohla -- select an installation source  • networkizikhethwa zomsebenzi wothungelwano -- the network options  • o_vncIzikhethwa ze-vnc -- options for installation via VNC
b) kernel options 
  • o_splashtshiza -- influence the behavior of the splash screen  • o_apmi-apm -- toggle power management  • o_acpii-acpi -- advanced configuration and power interface  • o_idei-ide -- control the IDE subsystem
Buyela mainUncedo Lomlayishi Womiselo Lwenkqubo.o_hostipo_netmasko_gatewaynetworkIzikhethwa Zomhlohli: Izikhethwa Zomsebenzi WothungelwanoIt is possible to configure the network interface right now. The hardware will be detected later by YaST2. The minimum set of options to configure your network card consists of host IP and netmask. For example: 
  • hostip=192.168.0.10 netmask=255.255.255.0
or in a shorter form: 
  • hostip=192.168.0.10/24
If you specified a o_installukuhlohla okusekwe kumsebenzi wothungelwano and do not specify both of these options, the installer tries to configure the network interface with i-dhcp. If you need a default gateway, specify this with the option Indlela yesango. For example: 
  • indlela yesango=192.168.0.8
Buyela optIzikhethwa Zomiselo Lwenkqubo.o_acpiIzikhethwa ze-Kernel: i-acpiACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) is a standard that defines power and configuration management interfaces between an operating system and the BIOS. By default, i-acpi is switched on when a BIOS is detected that is newer than from year 2000. There are several commonly used parameters to control the behavior of ACPI: 
  • i-pci=noacpi -- do not use ACPI to route PCI interrupts  • i-acpi=umiselolwakudala -- only the parts of ACPI that are relevant for booting remain activated  • i-acpi=imo yokungasebenzi -- switch off ACPI completely  • i-acpi=yonyanzelo -- switch on ACPI even if your BIOS is dated before 2000
Especially on new computers, it replaces the old o_apmi-apm system.
Buyela optIzikhethwa Zomiselo Lwenkqubo.o_apmIzikhethwa ze-Kernel: i-apmAPM is one of the two power management strategies used on current computers. It is mainly used with laptops for functions like suspend to disk, but it may also be responsible for switching off the computer after power down. APM relies on a correct working BIOS. If the BIOS is broken, APM may have only limited use or even prevent the computer from working. Therefore, it may be switched off with the parameter 
  • i-apm=imo yokungasebenzi -- switch off APM completely
Some very new computers may take more advantage from the newer o_acpii-ACPI.
Buyela optIzikhethwa Zomiselo Lwenkqubo.o_ideIzikhethwa ze-Kernel: i-ideIDE is, unlike SCSI, commonly used in most desktop workstations. To circumvent some hardware problems that occur with IDE systems, use the kernel parameter: 
  • i-ide=nodma -- switch off DMA for IDE drives
Buyela optIzikhethwa Zomiselo Lwenkqubo.o_installIzikhethwa Zomhlohli: hlohlaBy default, the local CD-ROMs are searched for the installation source. For a network install, select the hlohla option. Possible installation protocols are 
  • FTP  • NFS  • HTTP
The syntax to use is just like standard URLs. For example, if your server is found at 192.168.0.1 and you want to do an NFS-based install from the directory /install on this server, specify the source as follows: 
  • ukuhlohla=nfs://192.168.0.1/ukuhlohla
The network card will either be configured with i-dhcp or you must specify the parameters yourself as described in the networkizikhethwa zomsebenzi wothungelwano.
Buyela optIzikhethwa Zomiselo Lwenkqubo.o_splashIzikhethwa ze-Kernel: tshizaThe splash screen is the picture shown during system start-up. 
  • tshiza=0 -- The splash screen is switched off. This may be useful with very old monitors or if some error occurs.  • tshiza=umlembelele -- Activates splash, kernel and boot messages are still shown.  • tshiza=ngokuthula -- Activates splash, but no messages. Instead a progress bar is drawn.
Buyela optIzikhethwa Zomiselo Lwenkqubo.o_vncpasswordo_vncIzikhethwa Zomhlohli: i-vncTo enable the VNC installation, specify the parameters vnc and vncpassword: 
  • vnc=1 vncigamalokugqithisa=umzekelo
The VNC server will be started and you may control YaST2 over any VNC client from a remote system.
Buyela optIzikhethwa Zomiselo Lwenkqubo.rescueIsixokelelwano SokuhlangulaThe Isixokelelwano Sokuhlangula is a small RAM disk base system. From there, it is possible to make all kinds of changes to an installed system. Because only low-level tools are available in this system, it is intended for experts.
