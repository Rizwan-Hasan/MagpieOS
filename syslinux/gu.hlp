There is no guarantee that the memory is good if no errors are found, although most of memory defects will be found.
પાછા ફરો mainબુટ લોડર મદદnoacpiઈન્સ્ટોલેશન -- ACPI ડિસેબલ્ડCurrent hardware usually requires ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) to control the interrupt handling. ACPI completely replaces the old APM system.
Select ઈન્સ્ટોલેશન -- ACPI ડિસેબલ્ડ if you encounter problems during boot of the kernel. Known problems with machines that have problems with ACPI are: 
  • kernel freezes when booting  • PCI Cards are not detected or initialized properly
You may also try the firmwareફર્મવેર ટેસ્ટ boot option and look at the test results of the ACPI validation.

Please don't confuse this with noacpiACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface).
પાછા ફરો mainબુટ લોડર મદદoptબુટ વિકલ્પોThere are two types of boot options available. First, there are options that affect the installer. Second, there are kernel options. Some of the more common options are:
a) installer options 
  • o_installઈન્સ્ટોલ -- select an installation source  • networkનેટવર્ક વિકલ્પો -- the network options  • o_vncvnc વિકલ્પો -- options for installation via VNC
b) kernel options 
  • o_splashસ્પ્લેશ -- influence the behavior of the splash screen  • o_apmapm -- toggle power management  • o_acpiacpi -- advanced configuration and power interface  • o_ideide -- control the IDE subsystem
પાછા ફરો mainબુટ લોડર મદદo_hostipo_netmasko_gatewaynetworkઈન્સ્ટોલર વિકલ્પો: નેટવર્ક વિકલ્પોIt is possible to configure the network interface right now. The hardware will be detected later by YaST2. The minimum set of options to configure your network card consists of host IP and netmask. For example: 
  • hostip=192.168.0.10 netmask=255.255.255.0
or in a shorter form: 
  • hostip=192.168.0.10/24
If you specified a o_installનેટવર્ક-બેઝ્ડ ઈન્સ્ટોલ and do not specify both of these options, the installer tries to configure the network interface with dhcp. If you need a default gateway, specify this with the option ગેટવે. For example: 
  • ગેટવે=192.168.0.8
પાછા ફરો optબુટ વિકલ્પોo_acpiકેર્નાલ વિકલ્પો: acpiACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) is a standard that defines power and configuration management interfaces between an operating system and the BIOS. By default, acpi is switched on when a BIOS is detected that is newer than from year 2000. There are several commonly used parameters to control the behavior of ACPI: 
  • pci=noacpi -- do not use ACPI to route PCI interrupts  • acpi=oldboot -- only the parts of ACPI that are relevant for booting remain activated  • acpi=off -- switch off ACPI completely  • acpi=force -- switch on ACPI even if your BIOS is dated before 2000
Especially on new computers, it replaces the old o_apmapm system.
પાછા ફરો optબુટ વિકલ્પોo_apmકેર્નાલ વિકલ્પોAPM is one of the two power management strategies used on current computers. It is mainly used with laptops for functions like suspend to disk, but it may also be responsible for switching off the computer after power down. APM relies on a correct working BIOS. If the BIOS is broken, APM may have only limited use or even prevent the computer from working. Therefore, it may be switched off with the parameter 
  • apm=off -- switch off APM completely
Some very new computers may take more advantage from the newer o_acpiACPI.
પાછા ફરો optબુટ વિકલ્પોo_ideકેર્નાલ વિકલ્પો: ideIDE is, unlike SCSI, commonly used in most desktop workstations. To circumvent some hardware problems that occur with IDE systems, use the kernel parameter: 
  • ide=nodma -- switch off DMA for IDE drives
પાછા ફરો optબુટ વિકલ્પોo_installઈન્સ્ટોલર વિકલ્પો: ઈન્સ્ટોલBy default, the local CD-ROMs are searched for the installation source. For a network install, select the ઈન્સ્ટોલ option. Possible installation protocols are 
  • FTP  • NFS  • HTTP
The syntax to use is just like standard URLs. For example, if your server is found at 192.168.0.1 and you want to do an NFS-based install from the directory /install on this server, specify the source as follows: 
  • install=nfs://192.168.0.1/install
The network card will either be configured with dhcp or you must specify the parameters yourself as described in the networkનેટવર્ક વિકલ્પો.
પાછા ફરો optબુટ વિકલ્પોo_splashકેર્નાલ વિકલ્પો: સ્પ્લેશThe splash screen is the picture shown during system start-up. 
  • સ્પ્લેશ=0 -- The splash screen is switched off. This may be useful with very old monitors or if some error occurs.  • સ્પ્લેશ=નકામા શબ્દો -- Activates splash, kernel and boot messages are still shown.  • સ્પ્લેશ=નિશબ્દ -- Activates splash, but no messages. Instead a progress bar is drawn.
